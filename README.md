# Cucumber-Java Skeleton

This is the simplest possible build script setup for Cucumber using Java.
There is nothing fancy like a webapp or browser testing. All this does is to show
you how to install and run Cucumber!

There is a single feature file with one scenario. The scenario has three steps,
two of them pending. See if you can make them all pass!
